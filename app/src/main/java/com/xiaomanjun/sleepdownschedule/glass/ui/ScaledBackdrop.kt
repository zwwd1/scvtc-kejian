/**
 * Makes a backdrop sample the same pixels as a full-screen surface that is
 * visually scaled around its centre, without scaling the glass consumer.
 *
 * LayerBackdrop currently compensates translations only. When its recorded
 * layer is displayed through an outer graphicsLayer scale, a Dialog/overlay
 * therefore keeps sampling the unscaled coordinate space. Applying that same
 * scale around the root's window-space centre fixes the sample while leaving
 * the card/dialog geometry untouched.
